# Architecture Docs

!!! abstract "Philosophy"
    These docs are written to be **comprehensive and navigable at the same time**. We prefer compact, high-signal sections over fragmented notes, and we use callouts, emphasis, and direct links so readers can find key decisions quickly without hunting across pages.

!!! info "Two Audiences, One Contract"
    The split in site navigation is intentional. **User Docs** describe workflows and practical operation; **Architecture Docs** define implementation boundaries, invariants, and extension contracts. Both tracks must remain consistent.

!!! warning "Source-of-Truth Rule"
    Architecture Docs and the Jest suite are the implementation authority. If behavior diverges from this section, treat it as a defect and raise it to maintainers immediately. Contributor updates must be precise: append or modify only the relevant parts instead of rewriting unrelated content.

## Scope

This section is concept-first and implementation-bound. It documents ownership, data movement, invariants, extension points, and verification policy. Provider-specific mechanics stay in their feature pages so this area remains the stable system contract.

## Implementation Anchors

Event orchestration: `src/core/EventCache.ts`  
Web Worker manager: `src/workers/WorkerManager.ts`  
Centralized filtering & sorting: `src/core/EventFilterSortEngine.ts`  
In-memory indexes: `src/core/EventStore.ts`  
Normalization pipeline: `src/core/EventEnhancer.ts`  
Provider contract and routing: `src/providers/Provider.ts`, `src/providers/ProviderRegistry.ts`  
API entry points & bouncer: `src/api/PublicAPI.ts`, `src/api/LocalServer.ts`  
Internal API dispatcher: `src/api/InternalAPI.ts`  
View integration: `src/ui/view.ts`
