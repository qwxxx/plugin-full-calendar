# API and Security Settings

!!! abstract "Philosophy"
    Control your data. The API settings allow you to securely grant other Obsidian plugins or external tools permission to interact with your calendar and event data.

## API Token Management

Access these settings in **Full Calendar Settings → API & Security**.

*   **Authorized Tokens**: A list of all third-party plugins or scripts that have been granted access to the Full Calendar API. See: [Scopes & Permissions Architecture](../../architecture/api/scopes-permissions.md) and [Integration Recipes](../../architecture/api/recipes-blueprints.md).
    *   **Plugin ID**: The identifier of the requesting plugin.
    *   **Reason**: The purpose for which access was requested.
    *   **Granted Scopes**: The specific permissions (Read, Write, Full Access) assigned to the token.
    *   **Revoke Access**: Instantly invalidate a token to cut off access.

## Permission Scopes

The plugin enforces a granular permission model. When a third-party tool requests access, you can review and approve specific scopes:

*   **`ui` scopes**: Open the calendar, sidebar, or specific modals.
*   **`events` scopes**: Read or modify your event data.
*   **`providers` scopes**: Manage your calendar sources.
*   **`settings` scopes**: Read or update plugin configuration.
*   **`system:full-access`**: Unrestricted access to all plugin internals.

For detailed capability matrices and scope checking logic, see [Scopes & Permissions Spec](../../architecture/api/scopes-permissions.md).

## Security Best Practices

*   **Never share tokens**: API tokens are secret keys. Sharing them gives the recipient the ability to read or delete your calendar data.
*   **Audit regularly**: Review your Authorized Tokens list and revoke access for any plugins you no longer use.
*   **Least Privilege**: Only grant the minimum scopes required for a plugin to function.

## Secure Credential Storage

Full Calendar supports secure credential storage for sensitive data (Google Calendar, Outlook refresh/access tokens, custom Google client secrets, and CalDAV passwords).

*   **Keychain Storage (Default, Recommended)**: Automatically stores credentials in your OS keychain via Obsidian's native `SecretStorage` API. Plaintext passwords/tokens are nullified inside `data.json` to prevent local exposure.
*   **Plaintext Storage (Sync Compatibility)**: Enable **Store credentials in plaintext (sync compatibility)** under **Settings → Integrations** if you sync your Obsidian vault across devices and want to avoid re-logging on each device.

For architectural internals and code structure, see [Settings Architecture](../../architecture/settings/architecture.md#credential-storage-and-keychain-migration) and [API Architecture Overview](../../architecture/api/overview.md).
