## Design and Features

### 1. Free and Autonomic Geocoding
- Powered entirely by the free and open [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).
- No registration, subscription, or API keys are required to use this feature.
- Supports two input modes: **Place Name Resolution** (dynamic geocoding search) or **Manual GPS Coordinates** (latitude and longitude entry).

### 2. High-Performance Caching
- Forecast requests are cached in-memory using composite geolocation keys.
- Calendar navigation is instant, smooth, and flicker-free, avoiding redundant API network queries.
- Cache refreshes automatically when you modify coordinates or restart Obsidian.

### 3. Smart Future-Range Clamping
- The Open-Meteo free tier restricts forecast lookaheads to a maximum of 16 days.
- When navigating broad views (such as Month View, which spans up to 42 cells), the plugin automatically and safely clamps requests to the range `[today - 3 days, today + 14 days]`.
- This guarantees reliable API success while shielding the calendar from loading errors on far-future dates.

```

### Step 3: Set Temperature Unit
- Select your preferred **Temperature unit** (either **Celsius (°C)** or **Fahrenheit (°F)**) using the dropdown menu. This will instantly convert and update all weather displays across your calendar.

### Step 4: Set Location
- **City / Region Mode (Recommended):**
  - Enter your place name (e.g., `Prague` or `London, UK`) in the **Weather city / region** text box.
  - The plugin will automatically run a debounced geocoding search.
  - A real-time status message will update from `Resolving location...` to `Resolved: Lat XX.XXXX, Lng XX.XXXX` in green.
- **Latitude / Longitude Mode:**
  - Switch the dropdown to **Coordinates**.
  - Enter your target **Latitude** and **Longitude** values directly in the fields (e.g., `50.088` and `14.4208`).
  - Values are automatically parsed and saved when you focus out or press enter.

## Step 4: Hide/Show Control
- To completely hide weather forecasts from all calendar views, turn on the **Hide weather forecast in calendar UI** toggle.

## Interactive Interface Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have enabled the weather feature but have not yet configured coordinates, the calendar views will display a beautiful placeholder panel in the header:
> 
> `🌤️❓ Set weather location / Click to configure`
> 
> Clicking this placeholder will **automatically open** the Full Calendar settings panel to guide you directly to the configuration modal!

### Premium Detailed Weather & Hourly Timeline Modal

Once configured, the weather thumbnails on the calendar views become fully interactive:
- **How to Open**: Click directly on the weather card (in **Day/Week Views**) or the weather emoji (in **Month View**). The hover state highlights the thumbnail with a pointer cursor.
- **Vibrant Summary**: Displays a responsive summary card with a large floating condition emoji, text description, and the day's temperature range.
- **Hourly Forecast Timeline**: A beautiful, horizontally scrollable swipe-enabled timeline that showcases conditions for each hour of the day:
  - **Condition Emoji & Time**: Clear visual timeline markers.
  - **Apparent Temperature**: Tells you what the temperature actually feels like.
  - **Precipitation Probability (💧)**: Shows real-time rain/snow chance percentage.
  - **Relative Humidity (💦)**: Shows current air moisture.
  - **Wind Speed (💨)**: Shows wind velocity in km/h.
- **Zero API Overhead**: Because the plugin fetches and caches both daily and hourly forecasts in a single background query during navigation, opening the modal takes **0ms and makes zero additional network requests**.
- **Community Footer**: The bottom of the detailed modal features a unified footer allowing you to directly *suggest a feature*, *raise an issue*, or *buy the creators a coffee*.
